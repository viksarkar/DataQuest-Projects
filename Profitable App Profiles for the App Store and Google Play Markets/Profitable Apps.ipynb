    "\n",
    "As we mentioned in the introduction, our aim is to determine the kinds of apps that are likely to attract more users because our revenue is highly influenced by the number of people using our apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize risks and overhead, our validation strategy for an app idea is comprised of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play.\n",
    "2. If the app has a good response from users, we then develop it further.\n",
    "3. If the app is profitable after six months, we also build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our end goal is to add the app on both the App Store and Google Play, we need to find app profiles that are successful on both markets. For instance, a profile that might work well for both markets might be a productivity app that makes use of gamification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin the analysis by getting a sense of the most common genres for each market. For this, we'll build a frequency table for the `prime_genre` column of the App Store data set, and the `Genres` and `Category` columns of the Google Play data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part Two\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build two functions we can use to analyze the frequency tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One function to generate frequency tables that show percentages\n",
    "- Another function that we can use to display the percentages in a descending order\n"

We can use the category labels as the actual number of installs - we consider that an app with 100,000+ installs has 100,000 installs, and an app with 1,000,000+ installs has 1,000,000 installs, and so on.\n",
